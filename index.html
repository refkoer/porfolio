            <p class="gutter-1 not-bold micro">Hello, It's me. I'm Raphael Astrologo Hipolito, a Graphic/Motion Designer based in Ottawa. Why Sleepless you ask? It's a psuedonym that I have been using for quite awhile for my artwork and I figured why not continue on using it for my Graphic Design work. I'm very interested on expanding my knowledge on Filmography, Cinematography, Colour Grading, Video Editing, User Interface animation, and other crazy motion work the industry can offer. </p>
