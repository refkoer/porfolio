    <p class="gutter-1 not-bold milli">Hi, I'm Raphael Astrlogo Hipolito. Long name right? I've been using Sleepless as a pseudo name for quite a while now, so I went with it to represent myself and the work that I do. I'm a 3rd year Graphic design student at Algonquin college. I love movement as you can see on this site, but I'ved been focusing a lot on Motion graphics, old cartoons, UI/UX animation, credit and opening scenes from movies are inspiration behind my work. New thing makes everything exciting, even though I'm on final year I look forward on learning new things that the industry can offer!</p>
