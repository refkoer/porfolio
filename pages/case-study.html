      <p class="gutter-1 not-bold milli">Branding Identity project. This is the most recent addition the projects that we had for Motion Graphics, we were tasked to create a branding identity using an existing brand, service or product. I chose to do a band called Code Orange. They're a Hardcore/Metalcore band from the U.S. I decided to use a band because most musicians or music groups rely on a lot on personal branding to give out a certain feel or mood for their music. By using the already existing branding guidelines that the band had, with some reseach and the instructions they have provided and video clips in their website, I created an Ad for their album release a year ago called Forever. </p>
