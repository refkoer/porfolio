      <p class="gutter-1 not-bold milli">as you can see, I love food. This is an advert to promote a product from the restaurant i work in. stop motion was used to create the video to show how a burger is built from bun to bun.
        with a help of a catchy song, strong visuals and colours i think it helps the ad to advocate how sexy food is, burgers especially.</p>
