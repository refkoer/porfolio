      <p class="gutter-1 not-bold milli">This one is rather a weird concept, it’s inspired by sleep deprivation. with than given, I used an exploration of the use of rotoscope animation. it’s drawing on top of an existing video clip. I approached this project with more emotion and going in depth with human movment and change. Each piece are drawn frame by frame to show how the body, facial structure and eyes change depending on the human mood.</p>
